            <ul id="lis">
                <li>IN THE SPRING AND FALL LATE MORNING AND MID-DAY SUN FALLS ON TILE FLOOR OF THE SALON, 
                    MAKING THE SPACE WARM AND COMFORTABLE. </li>
                <li>IN THE SUMMER, ONLY MINIMAL SUNLIGHT ENTERS,</li>
                <li>IN THE WINTER THE ANGLE IS SO LOWTHAT IT DOES NOT HEAT THE FLOOR EXTENSIVELY. </li>
                <li>THE SPACE IS THERMALLY COMFORTABLE IN MID DAY IN SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL</li>
                <img id="imgvilla5" src="Image/villa5.png" alt="villa SAVOYE">
                <li>Salon has thermal mass in floor that is warmed by midday sun in spring and fall. </li>
                <li>In summer thermal mass is not hit by sun so retains coolness. </li>
                <li>In spring and fall, the salon is warmer than surrounding spaces. </li>
                <li>In summer it is cooler. </li>
                <li>Solarium on roof catches midday sun all year. So it always heats up to be warmer than surrounding air. </li>
                <li>Setting sun can be seen from table on patio. Glare shielded by wall above opening and by trees. </li>
                <li>The floors are built of terracotta tile so have little insulation value. Floors not lit by sun will be cool.</li>
                <li>Patio receives breeze from SW in summer. It is sheltered from cold NW wind in winter.</li>
